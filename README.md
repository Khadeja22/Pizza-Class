# Pizza-Class

This Java project showcases the development of a Pizza class, designed to model various pizza orders. The Pizza class incorporates instance data, constructors, accessor and mutator methods, a custom discount calculation method, and a custom toString method. It also maintains a count of the Pizza objects instantiated using a static variable.
